# Handling-Categorical-Variables-Encoding-And-Modeling
Objective of the project is to show complete exploration to understand the categorical data, technique of handing categorical variables and after it I will build a Machine Learning Model.

# Ecoding Technique Used in The Project
* Binary Encoding
* One Hot Encoding
* Feature Hashing
* Encoding with the Frequency
* Label Encoding
* Ordinal Encoding
* Encoding cyclic features

# Data Description
In this competition, you will be predicting the probability [0, 1] of a binary target column.

The data contains binary features (bin_*), nominal features (nom_*), ordinal features (ord_*) as well as (potentially cyclical) day (of the week) and month features. The string ordinal features ord_{3-5} are lexically ordered according to string.ascii_letters.

Since the purpose of this competition is to explore various encoding strategies, the data has been simplified in that (1) there are no missing values, and (2) the test set does not contain any unseen feature values (See this). (Of course, in real-world settings both of these factors are often important to consider!)
